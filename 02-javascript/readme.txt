JavaScript Training

You can copy the individual pieces of executable javascript code to index.js
and run the index.js as >>node index.js

node index.js

code .
new file index.html
! and tab

script tags to be kept at the end of the body tags so that script executes at the end after the html is rendered. 

Run the javascript inside a node js javascript engine. Node is a javascript engine that is built with the chrome v8 javascript engine. Chrome has provided this javascript engine as an opensource. An engineer took the open source chrome v8 javascript engine and created Node JS. Node JS doesn't need to be inside browser
it can be anywhere.
